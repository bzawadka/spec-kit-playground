- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All requirements have been clarified and the specification is ready for planning. The following decisions have been made:
1. Floor plan will be provided as a static PNG image
2. Photo gallery will be limited to 12 high-quality images
3. Contact methods will include email, phone number, and WhatsApp QR code

**Context**: "Floor plan or room layout visualization"

**What we need to know**: Should we include an interactive floor plan or static image?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| A | Static image only | Simpler implementation, faster loading, but less interactive experience |
| B | Interactive floor plan | Better user experience, allows zooming and room highlighting, but more complex to implement |
| C | Both options | Provide static image with option to open interactive view, balanced approach |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify your preferred approach for floor plan visualization |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_

## Question 2: Photo Gallery Size

**Context**: "High-quality images of all rooms"

**What we need to know**: Maximum number of photos to include while maintaining site performance?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| A | 10-15 photos maximum | Focused selection of best shots, optimal for performance |
| B | 20-25 photos | More comprehensive coverage, might affect load time |
| C | 30+ photos | Complete coverage of all details, requires careful optimization |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify your preferred maximum number of photos |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_

## Question 3: Contact Method

**Context**: "Clear call-to-action for inquiries"

**What we need to know**: Preferred contact method - form submission or direct email/phone?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| A | Direct email and phone only | Simple implementation, immediate contact option, but no lead tracking |
| B | Contact form only | Structured inquiries, spam protection, but requires form handling |
| C | Both form and direct contact | Maximum flexibility for users, requires maintaining both systems |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify your preferred contact method approach |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
